Data, R markdown and scripts are for analyzing the marriage licenses in city of Toronto. 

I am curious with do couples have a general preference on the season to register for their marriage? If so, what factors drive that season become popular? So I think it is valuable to process this analysis.

Scripts contain R scripts to clean and organize the selected data set. Outputs folder include my Rmarkdown file and its PDF version.

The inputs contain my raw data for this analysis.
